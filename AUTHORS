  Acknowledgments
  ---------------

  It is both a moral obligation and a personal pleasure to acknowledge and
  express the due gratitude to my colleague and friend Dr. Renê Souza Pinto.
  His wise advisory and tireless support have been invaluable. If it were not
  for Renê's outstanding technical skills and readiness to promptly share his
  knowledge, as well as his resolute willing to dig into obscure coding issues
  and arcane hardware puzzles, this material would likely have taking much
  more time to be produced.

  I'd like also to express my gratitude to my students for their feedback,
  suggestions and source code fixes.
