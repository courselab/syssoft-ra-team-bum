dnl       If you're looking for a file such as README or Makefile, then this one 
dnl       you are reading now is probably not the file you are interested in. This
dnl       and other files named with suffix '.m4' are source files used by SYSeg
dnl       to create the actual documentation files, scripts and other items they
dnl       refer to. If you can't find a corresponding file without the '.m4' name
dnl       extension in this same directory, then chances are that you have missed
dnl       the build instructions in the README file at the top of SYSeg's source
dnl       tree (yep, it's called README for a reason).

 Test cases
 ==============================

 Contents in this directory are aimed at the purpose of testing procedures.

 As a convention, for each program foo to be tested, a directory foo contains
 an automake script foo.am with rules to perform all tests available for foo.
 Auxiliary scripts and data items for the test may also be found in that
 directory. A corresponding entry in Makefile.am is responsible for triggering
 the test cases.
