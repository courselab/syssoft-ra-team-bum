		   As a side note, the column 'Flg' shows the section flags,
		   which specify the properties of each section, so the OS can
		   handle them accordingly. For instance, AX in '.text' means
		   that the section is loaded into memory (not all sections
		   are, e.g. .comment), and that it's executable. Contrast with
		   '.rodataÂ´, which is not executable (the OS will refuse to
		   execute code from this section. This section is not
		   writable, differently from '.data' (W), which holds global
		   variables.
