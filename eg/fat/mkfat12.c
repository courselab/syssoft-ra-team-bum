  /* DOS startup code is a jump to the begining of the boostrap program.

     Remeber: BIOS loads the first 512 bytes of the storage device into
     address 0x7c00 and transfer execution to that location. The first
     three bytes in our formatted media (that will be at 0x7c00) tells the
     CPU to jump all the BPB data and land at the offset of 0x03e (from the
     begining of the device) where lays the bootstrap code.

      jmp 0x3c  ; jump to an offset of 0x03c starting from the next instruction
      nop	; does nothing

     In terms of opcodes, that yields

      eb 3c
      90

     We need to fill in the three bytes into char bpb.dos_startup_code[3].

     If we do not want to manually iterate through the array positions,
     we can cast bpb.dos_startup_code as an int, and asign it a literal
     value. We just need to remember that x86 is little endian.

     Block devices such as HD and USB flash sticks cannot read individual bytes
     form the media; instead, they read blocks of bytes. The minimum size of a
     read-write block that can be physically addressed by the device is referred
     to as a disk sector --- which usually counts 512 bytes. Oftentimes,
     aiming at efficiency improvement, the sector size reported by the hardware
     to the system software layer (e.g. to BIOS or to  the OS) may be different.
     For instance, newer devices are migrating to the Advanced Format standard,
     in which a disk sector has 4K, rather than 512 bytes (4k = 8 * 512).
     In order to support legacy systems, those devices can emulate 512-byte
     block devices. Disk sectors are this also reffered to as logical sector,
     which correponds to the read-write block reported by the device.
     A logical sector size (known by BIOS) is less or equal the physical sector
     size (actualy used by the device's hardware).

     We need only care about the logical sector here.

     use of the media capacity and more read-write operations. Rather,
     it is often more advantageous to group disk sectors into clusters
     and address those clusters instead of individual disk sectors. While
     the disk sector is the least read-write unit at the device level,
     a cluster is the least read-write unity at the file system level ---
