/* Notes.

   (1) When a child is forked, it inherits the signal dispositions from the
       parent process. When the process calls exec(), its ignored signals
       remain ignored; its signal handlers, however are reset to their defaults.
       This makes sense, since the handler implemented by the program won't
       exist when the image is replaced by exec().

       That's why, contrarily to what we did in sigaction.c, here we can't
       use exec() to run an existing program.
